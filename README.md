# proc-collector
Tools for collecting computer system statistics and transforming to analytical format

The intention of the project is to be able to store the content in the Linux /proc folder with a given frequency and store this as an easily parseable format.

This data can then be converted into a format, e.g., parquet, that is suitable for analytics.
